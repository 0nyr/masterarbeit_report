  abstractNote = {Digital forensics is the process of extracting, preserving, and documenting evidence in digital devices. A commonly used method in digital forensics is to extract data from the main memory of a digital device. However, the main challenge is identifying the important data to be extracted. Several pieces of crucial information reside in the main memory, like usernames, passwords, and cryptographic keys such as SSH session keys. In this paper, we propose SmartKex, a machine-learning assisted method to extract session keys from heap memory snapshots of an OpenSSH process. In addition, we release an openly available dataset and the corresponding toolchain for creating additional data. Finally, we compare SmartKex with naive brute-force methods and empirically show that SmartKex can extract the session keys with high accuracy and high throughput. With the provided resources, we intend to strengthen the research on the intersection between digital forensics, cybersecurity, and machine learning.},

However, the recent increase of dimensionality of data poses a severe challenge to many existing feature selection and feature extraction methods with respect to efficiency and effectiveness. In the field of machine learning and pattern recognition, dimensionality reduction is important area, where many approaches have been proposed. In this paper, some widely used feature selection and feature extraction techniques have analyzed with the purpose of how effectively these techniques can be used to achieve high performance of learning algorithms that ultimately improves predictive accuracy of classifier. An endeavor to analyze dimensionality reduction techniques briefly with the purpose to investigate strengths and weaknesses of some widely used dimensionality reduction methods is presented.}

	abstract     = {Network embedding is an important method to learn low-dimensional representations of vertexes in networks, aiming to capture and preserve the network structure. Almost all the existing network embedding methods adopt shallow models. However, since the underlying network structure is complex, shallow models cannot capture the highly non-linear network structure, resulting in sub-optimal network representations. Therefore, how to find a method that is able to effectively capture the highly non-linear network structure and preserve the global and local structure is an open yet important problem. To solve this problem, in this paper we propose a Structural Deep Network Embedding method, namely SDNE. More specifically, we first propose a semi-supervised deep model, which has multiple layers of non-linear functions, thereby being able to capture the highly non-linear network structure. Then we propose to exploit the first-order and second-order proximity jointly to preserve the network structure. The second-order proximity is used by the unsupervised component to capture the global network structure. While the first-order proximity is used as the supervised information in the supervised component to preserve the local network structure. By jointly optimizing them in the semi-supervised deep model, our method can preserve both the local and global network structure and is robust to sparse networks. Empirically, we conduct the experiments on five real-world networks, including a language network, a citation network and three social networks. The results show that compared to the baselines, our method can reconstruct the original network significantly better and achieves substantial gains in three applications, i.e. multi-label classification, link prediction and visualization.},

  abstract = {Existing package and system configuration management tools suffer from an imperative model, where system administration actions such as upgrading packages or changes to system configuration files are stateful: they destructively update the state of the system. This leads to many problems, such as the inability to roll back changes easily, to run multiple versions of a package side-by-side, to reproduce a configuration deterministically on another machine, or to reliably upgrade a system. In this paper we show that we can overcome these problems by moving to a purely functional system configuration model. This means that all static parts of a system (such as software packages, configuration files and system startup scripts) are built by pure functions and are immutable, stored in a way analogously to a heap in a purely function language. We have implemented this model in NixOS, a non-trivial Linux distribution that uses the Nix package manager to build the entire system configuration from a purely functional specification.},

We introduce three adaptation rules that can be used in iterative training of a k-{NN} classifier. This is a novel approach both from the statistical pattern recognition and the supervised neural network learning points of view. The suggested learning rules resemble those of the well-known Learning Vector Quantization ({LVQ}) method, but at the same time the classifier utilizes the fact that increasing the number of samples that the classification is based on leads to improved classification accuracy. The performances of the suggested learning rules are compared with the usual k-{NN} rules and the {LVQl} algorithm.},

	abstract = {The most successful Machine Learning ({ML}) systems remain complex black boxes to end-users, and even experts are often unable to understand the rationale behind their decisions. The lack of transparency of such systems can have severe consequences or poor uses of limited valuable resources in medical diagnosis, financial decision-making, and in other high-stake domains. Therefore, the issue of {ML} explanation has experienced a surge in interest from the research community to application domains. While numerous explanation methods have been explored, there is a need for evaluations to quantify the quality of explanation methods to determine whether and to what extent the offered explainability achieves the defined objective, and compare available explanation methods and suggest the best explanation from the comparison for a specific task. This survey paper presents a comprehensive overview of methods proposed in the current literature for the evaluation of {ML} explanations. We identify properties of explainability from the review of definitions of explainability. The identified properties of explainability are used as objectives that evaluation metrics should achieve. The survey found that the quantitative metrics for both model-based and example-based explanations are primarily used to evaluate the parsimony/simplicity of interpretability, while the quantitative metrics for attribution-based explanations are primarily used to evaluate the soundness of fidelity of explainability. The survey also demonstrated that subjective measures, such as trust and confidence, have been embraced as the focal point for the human-centered evaluation of explainable systems. The paper concludes that the evaluation of {ML} explanations is a multidisciplinary research topic. It is also not possible to define an implementation of evaluation metrics, which can be applied to all explanation methods.},

Hence a new wave of algorithms based on training language models such as Open AI GPT and BERT has been proposed to generate contextual word embeddings that use as input word constituents allowing them to generate representations for out-of-vocabulary words by combining the word pieces. Recently, fine-tuning pre-trained language models that have been trained on large corpora have constantly advanced the state of the art for many NLP tasks.",

  abstractnote = {Botnets are causing severe damages to users, companies, and governments through information theft, abuse of online services, DDoS attacks, etc. Although significant research is being made to detect them and mitigate their effect, they are exponentially increasing due to new zero-day attacks, a variation of their behavior, and obfuscation techniques. High Interaction Honeypots (HIH) are the only honeypots able to capture attacks and log all the information generated by attackers when setting up a botnet. The data generated is being processed using Machine Learning (ML) techniques for detection since they can detect hidden patterns. However, so far, research has been focused on intermediate phases of the botnet’s life cycle during operation, underestimating the initial phase of infection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first solution in the infection phase of SSH-based botnets. Therefore, we have designed an approach based on an SSH-based HIH to generate a dataset consisting of executed commands and network information. Herein, we have applied ML techniques for the development of a real-time detection model. This approach reached a very high level of prediction and zero false negatives. Indeed, our system detected all known and unknown SSH sessions intended to infect our honeypots. Thus, our research has demonstrated that new SSH infections can be detected through ML techniques.}

With the motivation of detecting masqueraders on clusters, this work seeks to discriminate different types of users based on their command behavior - in particular, user command behavior on a multi-user public machine versus user command behavior on a high performance computing cluster. Our intuition is that these users act differently and the unique high performance cluster environment is constrained such that command behavior discrimination is enhanced versus enterprise environments. We formalize this into a classification problem to be solved by a support vector machine with TF-IDF feature construction techniques from the field of Information Retrieval. We present results showing the effectiveness of this approach exhibiting high precision depending on the length of monitoring in both time and number of commands. In particular we show that as few as 10 commands may be enough to recognize a masquerading attacker on a high performance computing cluster.}

Data confidentiality, authentication, and privacy, denial of service, nonrepudiation, and digital content protection are only a few of the difficult security challenges that must be handled. To exploit these resource-constrained Cyber-physical systems, attackers use brute-force assaults, man-in-the-middle attacks, injecting malicious code, eavesdropping, and backdoors, among other methods. In this research, we present a hybrid analysis method for analyzing Linux-based IoT malware and event correlation for incident management using anomaly detection. For malware classification, the machine learning model is built using information from both static and dynamic analysis of harmful programs. For anomaly identification and event correlation, the anomalous DDoS traffic detection approach is also proposed. The F1-score is maximized for various DDoS attacks using the threshold selection approach, and the results are compared to the state-of-the-art literature.}

As attackers become more sophisticated with their ransomware and malware campaigns, there is a significant need for security researchers to assist the greater community by running vulnerable honeypot machines to collect malicious software. The ability to collect meaningful malware from attackers depends on how the attackers receive the honeypot. Most attackers fingerprint targets before they launch their attack, so it would be very beneficial for security researchers to understand how to hide honeypots from fingerprinting and trick the attackers into depositing malware. This study investigated the use of a cloaked and uncloaked SSH honeypot to learn how attackers fingerprint SSH honeypots and the efficacy of cloaking the honeypot by changing features that attackers fingerprint. This paper compares the number of logins and commands run by the attackers captured on default and cloaked Cowrie honeypots. The project lasted just over a month, and the cloaked honeypot received 74.5\% of the total login attempts and 53\% of the commands executed on the honeypot systems, as it was more believable than the uncloaked. This paper reports that modifying SSH honeypot systems improves malware collection effectiveness. This project focuses on monitoring attacker tactics on a standard SSH honeypot to understand their fingerprinting commands, integrate those that are missing into the cloaked honeypot, as well as adding/modifying files with which the attackers interact. The attackers utilized a variety of UNIX commands and files on the honeypots. The attackers who successfully logged into the SSH honeypot downloaded malware, including IRC bots, Mirai, Xmrig cryptominers, and many others. What is certain is that if a cautious attacker believes they are in a honeypot, they will leave without depositing malware onto the system, which reduces the effectiveness of the honeypot for security research.},

	abstractnote = {Botnets account for a substantial portion of cybercrime. Botmasters utilize darkweb marketplaces to promote and provide their services, which can vary from renting or buying a botnet (or parts of it) to hiring services (e.g., distributed denial of service attacks). At the same time, botnet takedown attempts have proven to be challenging, demanding a combination of technical and legal methods, and often requiring the collaboration of a plethora of entities with varying jurisdictions. In this article, we map the elements associated with the business aspect of botnets and utilize them to develop adaptations of two widely used business models. Furthermore, we analyze the 28 most notable botnet takedown operations carried out from 2008 to 2021, in regard to the methods employed, and illustrate the correlation between these methods and the segments of our adapted business models. Our analysis suggests that the botnet takedown methods have been mainly focused on the technical side, but not on the botnet economic components. We aim to shed light on new takedown vectors and incentivize takedown actors to expand their efforts to methods oriented more toward the business side of botnets, which could contribute toward eliminating some of the challenges that surround takedown operations.},
