\section{Dataset exploration}
The dataset that serves as the basis for this thesis has been introduced before (see \autoref{sec:background:kex:dataset}). At his heart, the dataset is a collection of heap dump RAW files for different use cases and versions of OpenSSH. Each heap dump file goes along a JSON annotation file that has been generated by the creators of the dataset to provide additional information about the heap dump, and especially encryption keys. In this section, we will describe the dataset exploration we have done to get a better understanding of the dataset. 

    \subsection{Estimating the dataset balancing for key prediction}
    First, let's quickly estimate what the dataset is composed about. This will later be used to estimate the balancing of data for our key prediction goal. Some quick linux commands can be used to get a general overview of the dataset.
    
    A first command can quickly give us an idea of the number of files in the dataset:
    \begin{lstlisting}[caption={Count all dataset files}, label=methods:code:count_all_dataset_files, language=bash]
        find /path/to/dataset -type f | wc -l
    \end{lstlisting}

    Another command can be used to get the total size of the dataset:
    \begin{lstlisting}[caption={Get the total size of the dataset}, label=methods:code:get_total_size_dataset, language=bash]
        du -sb /path/to/dataset
    \end{lstlisting}

    The first command indicates that the dataset contains $ 208749 $ files, which represents, according to second one, a total of $ 18203592048 $ bytes, or around 18 Gigabytes.

    We could just divide the number of files by the size of the dataset to get an average size of the files. However, this would not be accurate, as we are only interested in the size of the RAW files. Since JSON files are much smaller than RAW files, they would skew the average size of the files. Since we are only considering RAW files, we will use improved commands in order to determine the size of the RAW file only.

    The following command can be used to get a better understanding of the dataset, concerning the number of RAW files and their size:

    \begin{lstlisting}[caption={Find the number of RAW files in the dataset}, language=bash]
        find /path/to/dataset -type f -name "*.RAW" | wc -l
    \end{lstlisting}

    And the next one can be used to get the number of bytes of RAW files in the dataset:

    \begin{lstlisting}[caption={Find the number of bytes of RAW files in the dataset}, language=bash]
        find /path/to/dataset -type f -name "*.raw" -exec du -b {} + \
            | awk '{s+=$1} END {print s}'
    \end{lstlisting}

    Where:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \lstinline[language=bash]!find phdtrack_data/ -type f -name "*.raw"! finds all the files in the dataset that have the extension \lstinline[language=bash]!.raw!.
        \item \lstinline[language=bash]!-exec du -b {} + | awk '{s+=$1} END {print s}'! executes the command \lstinline[language=bash]!du -b! on each file found by the previous command, and sums the size of each file.
    \end{itemize}

    Theses commands indicate that the dataset contains $ 103595 $ RAW files, which represents a total of $ 18067001344 $ bytes, or around 18 Gigabytes. This shows that the vast majority of the data is contained in RAW files, with JSON files representing less than a percent of the dataset in term of byte size. As such, the average size for every RAW file is around 170 Kilobytes. 

    Now, considering that a given heap dump file is expecting to have only 6 keys (see \autoref{sec:background:ssh:ssh_keys}), with keys maximal possible size being of 64 bytes, we can estimate that we have at maximum $ 39780480 $ or around 40 Megabytes of positively labeled samples. This, considering the total useful size of around 18 Gigabytes, means that our dataset is very imbalanced, with an expected upper-bounded ratio of $ 0.0022\% $ of positively labeled samples or around $ 2:1000 $.

    Considering that, a frontal \acrshort{ml} binary classification approach will not work. This is why the present report will discuss feature engineering and graph-based memory representation. The idea is to embed more information to our keys so as to be able to fight effectively the imbalanceness of the raw data.

    \subsection{Exploring patterns in RAW heap dump files}
    Before diving into programming, we need to gain a better understanding of how to retreive useful information from heap dump raw file. For that matter, we will continue to experiment with simple commands in RAW heap dump files. Note that in the following, number bases are indicated, since endianness and conversions can get confusing.

    Let's start by looking back at the RAW file we already presented in \autoref{lst:hexdump-8bytes}.

    \subsubsection{Detecting potential pointers}
    The paper \citetitle{SmartKex22} indicates that the keys are 8-bytes aligned. In fact, this is the case for the whole heap dump file. This is why we have choosen to split the study of heap dump files in chunks or blocks of 8 bytes. The term \textit{block} in code is always refering to this, unless specified otherwise. The precision is important, since these blocks should not be confused with \textit{memory blocks} like the ones that are allocated by the \lstinline[language=c]|malloc()| function in C.

    \begin{minipage}{\dimexpr\linewidth-20pt}
        Let's re-open the heap dump file in vim, and let's use the following vim commands to explore the example heap dump file:

        \begin{itemize} 
            \item \lstinline[language=bash]!:%!xxd -c 8  5070-1643978841-heap.raw!: This vim command converts the opened file to a hex dump. The \lstinline[language=bash]!-c 8! option indicates that we want to display 8 bytes per line.
            \item \lstinline[language=bash]!:set hlsearch!: This vim command highlights the search results.
            \item \lstinline[language=bash]!:%s/\s\+//g!: This vim command removes all the whitespaces in the file.
            \item \lstinline[language=bash]!:%s/\v([0-9a-f]{8}:)/\1\ ! This vim command adds a whitespace after each 8 byte addresses.
            \item \lstinline[language=bash]!:%s/\v(([0-9a-f]{8}: )([0-9a-f]{16}))/\1\ ! This vim command adds a whitespace after each heap dump byte line.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{minipage}

    To find potential pointers, we can use the following command in vim:
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=bash, caption={Vim command to find potential pointers}]
        :/[0-9a-f]\{12}0\{4}
    \end{lstlisting}

    This is a search that looks for 12 hexadecimal digits followed by 4 zeros. This is because, the maximum possible addresses in the heap dump file have a size of around 12 hexadecimal digits, and because pointer addresses are in little-endian format, meaning that the last 4 bytes of the address are also the Most Significant Bytes (MSB) of the address. 
    
    The result is illustrated below:

    \includegraphics[width=16cm]{dataset/pointer_examples_1010-1644391327-heap_potential_pointer_highlight.png}

    We have information about the starting address of the heap using \lstinline[style=json]!"HEAP_START": "56343a198000"!. Considering that the example heap dump file contains $ 135169 $ bytes, this means that for this given heap dump file, the pointer addresses range from value $ 94782313037824_{10} $ and $ 94782313172993_{10} $. Note that the little-endian hexadecimal representation of the heap end address is \lstinline[language=c]!0x01901b3a3456! which is 12 character long, or 6 bytes long.

    Note that conversions here can get confusing, since potential pointer strings extracted from the heap dump file are given in little-endian hexadecimal format, but the heap start address from the JSON annotation file is given in big-endian hexadecimal format.

    \begin{minipage}{\dimexpr\linewidth-20pt}
        That way, we can refine the detection of potential pointers by only considering the bytes that are in the range of the heap. Potential pointers are highlighted with "<<<" in the following hex dump:

        \begin{lstlisting}[language=python, caption={Conversions function from hex strings to decimal $ int $ values}.]
        # conversion from hex to decimal
        def hex_str_to_int(hex_str: str) -> int:
            """
            Convert a normal (big-endian) hex string to an int.
            WARNING: HEAP_START in JSON is big-endian.
            """
            bytes_from_str = bytes.fromhex(hex_str)
            return int.from_bytes(
                bytes_from_str, byteorder='big', signed=False
            )
        
        def pointer_str_to_int(hex_str: str) -> int:
            """
            Convert a pointer hex string to an int.
            WARNING: Pointer hex strings are little-endian.
            """
            bytes_from_str = bytes.fromhex(hex_str)
            return int.from_bytes(
                bytes_from_str, byteorder='little', signed=False
            )
        \end{lstlisting}
    \end{minipage}

    Using the functions above, we can check which potential pointers are indeed within the heap dump range.

    \begin{minipage}{\dimexpr\linewidth-20pt}
        That way, we can refine the detection of potential pointers. In the following, pointers are highlighted with \lstinline[style=hexdump]!<<<! in the following hex dump:

        \begin{lstlisting}[style=hexdump, caption={8 bytes per line visualization of a Hex Dump from \textit{Training/basic/V\_7\_8\_P1/16/5070-1643978841-heap.raw}}]

            00000050: 80221a3a34560000 .".:4V.. <<<
            00000058: 007f1a3a34560000 ...:4V..

        \end{lstlisting}
    \end{minipage}

    One last check we can do, is verify if the potential pointers are  8-bytes aligned. This can be done by checking if the last 3 bits of the potential address are 0, or using a modulo 8 operation. A simple python function can be used to check that:

    \begin{lstlisting}[language=python, caption={Python function to check if a potential pointer is 8-bytes aligned}]
        def is_pointer_aligned(pointer: int) -> bool:
            """
            Check if a pointer is 8-bytes aligned.
            """
            return pointer % 8 == 0
    \end{lstlisting}

    Using this function on the potential pointers we have found so far, we can see that all of them are indeed 8-bytes aligned. This is a good sign for pointer detection.

\section{Programs development}
% describe the programs developped for the Masterarbeit
% * mem2graph

In Computer Sciences, it does't take long to realize that testing hypotheses, diving deeper in problems and finding solutions to them is a very iterative process that requires a lot of experimentation. As such, the development of scripts and programs has been a substantial part of this thesis, from the very beginning to the very end. In this process, we have used a variety of tools and programming languages, such as Rust, Python, Bash, or Nix just to name the programming language used. In this section, we will do a general overview of the programs we have developed for this thesis. More details about the programs will be discussed further in their respective chapters.


In this section, we will describe the programs we have developed for this thesis. We will first describe the program we have developed to explore the dataset. Then, we will describe the program we have developed to extract the data from the dataset. Finally, we will describe the program we have developed to analyze the data.


\section{Packaging and deployment with Nix}


Dataset in Methods Chapter: On the other hand, if the specific features and challenges of your dataset are more related to your methodology‚Äîfor example, how you cleaned, balanced, or sampled the data‚Äîthen these details would fit well into the Methods chapter. This is especially relevant if the issues tackled are more about "how-to" rather than "why."
