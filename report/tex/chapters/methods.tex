Describe the method/software/tool/algorithm you have developed here

Dataset in Methods Chapter: On the other hand, if the specific features and challenges of your dataset are more related to your methodology—for example, how you cleaned, balanced, or sampled the data—then these details would fit well into the Methods chapter. This is especially relevant if the issues tackled are more about "how-to" rather than "why."
